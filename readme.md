Repository for my Brainstation spring 2020 Capstone project.

The scope of the Capstone project is to visualize a pitcher's development over the course of their career and to predict what pitch a 
pitcher will throw during a specific scenario.

**Finalized files, working on completing the readme.md. Estimated completion: June 28, 2020.**

As such, many of the Notebooks are very messy and unordered.


If running from local machine, please ensure all files in the following folders are downloaded and the folder structure is the same as here:

- **main folder**
- **templates**
- **static**
- **saved_model**

Files in the `Notebooks` folder are not necessary for the application to run.


Once the files and folders have been downloaded and set up, you may run the `flask_app.py` script.

It will render a web page on **localhost:5000** where the web application is hosted.
