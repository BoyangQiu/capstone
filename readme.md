Repository for my Brainstation spring 2020 Capstone project.

The scope of the Capstone project is to visualize a pitcher's development over the course of their career and to predict what pitch a 
pitcher will throw during a specific scenario.

**Currently a work in progress**

If running from local machine, the order of files to run are:

1. ScrapingFangraphs.ipynb
2. datawrangling.ipynb
3. Data Processing.ipynb
